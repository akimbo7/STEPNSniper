# STEPNSniper
A script made to snipe activation codes from STEPN's discord server.

YOU NEED AN EMULATOR THAT RUNS THE STEPN APP!

If you're on Mac it's pretty easy, just download the STEPN app from the App Store. Any other OS I'd recommend Bluestacks.

 - Download the STEPN app from the Mac App Store.
 - Sign in with your email.
 - Get the co-ordinates of the box to type the code and the start button.
 - Enter the correct co-ordinates on line 11 and 16.
 - Run the script.

You can change what channel to scrape by changing the discord url in the code.
